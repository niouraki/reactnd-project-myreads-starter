# MyReads Project

This project is part of FEND Udacity Nanodegree. The goal is to create an application that shows the books one is currently reading, wants to read and has read. I added two functionalities of my own, a page that shows more information on the books that are on the selves and a rating system.

## How to run the app

1. Run npm install on the terminal to install the application.
2. Run npm start on the terminal to start the application.

## Functionality

The app's main page shows the three shelves. You can rate the book by clicking on the stars.
By clicking on books' button the user can change shelves.
Clicking on the button with the cross, the user will go to the search page to find more books to add.
Clicking on the button with the book, the user will go to the info page to learn more information about
the books and click on the link to find out even more.
